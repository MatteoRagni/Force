Force
=====

A web user interface for Torque Resource Manager.

Force is a web interface for Torque/Maui clusters, based on ssh2 libraries. It uses as backend Torque binaries to get info upon jobs' status, deletion and submission.
Security is granted through ssh and https sessions.

Actually, the interface is under development, so features aren't implemented yet.
